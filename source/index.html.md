# Intro

Welcome to the Blip.delivery API! Our API endpoints can be bundled into any application using the npm module `blip-deliveries`.

 This documents the use of the Blip.delivery API using server-side node.js, and will eventually document the library in other backend laguages.

 To get started with a live account, contact Blip to get a `storeID`. Alternatively, you can play around with the functions in testmode, by replacing the `storeID` with `'test'`

# Getting started

> To authorize, use this code:

```javascript
const blip = require('blip-deliveries')('YOURSTOREID'); // Livemode

const blip = require('blip-deliveries')('test'); // Testmode
```

```shell
# Authorization is done on a per-call basis. No authorization setup is needed when using Http
```

Blip uses a storeID to allow access to the API. You can register by [contacting sales](http://www.blip.delivery/).

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>YOURSTOREID</code> with your own storeID.
</aside>

# Get a delivery quote

This retrieves a live price for a delivery, given two addresses. If your account uses subscription based pricing, use `getDeliveriesLeft` instead.

### Required JSON

```javascript
const blip = require('blip-deliveries')('test'); // Testmode

const quote = await blip.getQuote({
    pickupAddress: "156 Enfield Place, Mississauga, ON",
    deliveryAddress: "100 City Centre drive, Mississauga, ON"
})
```

> Example request:

```shell
https://api.blip.delivery/getDeliveryPrice # Live API endpoint
https://us-central1-blip-testapp.cloudfunctions.net/getDeliveryPrice # Test API endpoint

JSON body:

{
	pickupAddress: "156 Enfield Place, Mississauga, ON",
    deliveryAddress: "100 City Centre drive, Mississauga, ON"
}
```


Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
pickupAddress | The address of your pickup point. Include the locality + city
deliveryAddress | The address of your delivery point. Include the locality + city

<aside class="success">
Remember â€” Blip uses googlemaps to parse the address. Always ensure you enter the complete address, or we will be unable to verify the correct coordinates.
</aside>

> Example response:

```json
{
  "blipFee": 100,
  "price": 337,
  "totalPrice": 447
}
```

<aside class="notice">
The prices returned are all in cents. eg. 421 == $ 4.21
</aside>

# Create a new delivery

This creates a new delivery request, and charges the card on file. If you do not have any card on file with us, [download]() the Blip Store app, and update your card details.

```javascript
var blip = require('blip-deliveries')('test'); //Replace 'test' with your storeID to switch to livemode

// All fields are required

const delivery = await blip.createNewDelivery({
    "delivery": {
        "instructions": "Deliver to the lobby",

### Response JSON

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
refund | A refund object verifying a successful refund was made
cancellation | A delivery object similar to one returned by `createNewDelivery`

# Get driver location

After a delivery has been accepted, it contains a `courier` property. The `courier` is a driver that has been dispatched, who's location updates every 500-700 meters. This function should not be called more than once every 3 minutes, as doing so may result in excess charges to your account. Furthermore, a status code of `400` will be returned if the `deliveryID` references a delivery that has not been picked up. To ensure a status code of `200`, make sure to call `getDeliveryStatus` first, and check if it contains a `courier` property.

To get the current location of your driver, use `getDriverLocation(options)` where `options` is an object containing the `deliveryID` of the delivery to track

```javascript
var blip = require('blip-deliveries')('test'); //Replace 'test' with your storeID to switch to livemode

// A deliveryID is required

const status = await blip.getDriverLocation({
    "deliveryID": "ASF781"
})
```

> Example request

```shell
https://api.blip.delivery/getDriverLocation # Live API endpoint

https://us-central1-blip-testapp.cloudfunctions.net/getDriverLocation # Test API endpoint

JSON body:

{
	"deliveryID": "ASF781",
	"storeID": "L12354Hhhf9-f"
}
```

### Required JSON

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
deliveryID | String deliveryID of a delivery created using `createNewDelivery`

	"longitude": -79.6404522
}
```

### Response JSON

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
latitude | Number indicating the current latitude of the driver on your job
longitude | Number indicating the current longitude of the driver on your job

# Get deliveries
