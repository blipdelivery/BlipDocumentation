# Intro

Welcome to the Blip.delivery API! Our API endpoints can be bundled into any application using the npm module `blip-deliveries`.

 This documents the use of the Blip.delivery API using server-side node.js, and will eventually document the library in other backend laguages.

 To get started with a live account, contact Blip to get a `storeID`. Alternatively, you can play around with the functions in testmode, by replacing the `storeID` with `'test'`

# Getting started

> To authorize, use this code:

```shell
# Authorization is done on a per-call basis. No authorization setup is needed when using Http
```

Blip uses a storeID to allow access to the API. You can register by [contacting sales](http://www.blip.delivery/).

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>YOURSTOREID</code> with your own storeID.
</aside>

# Get a delivery quote

This retrieves a live price for a delivery, given two addresses. If your account uses subscription based pricing, use `getDeliveriesLeft` instead.

# Get driver location

After a delivery has been accepted, it contains a `courier` property. The `courier` is a driver that has been dispatched, who's location updates every 500-700 meters. This function should not be called more than once every 1 minute, as doing so may result in excess charges to your account. Furthermore, a status code of `400` will be returned if the `deliveryID` references a delivery that has not been picked up. To ensure a status code of `200`, make sure to call `getDeliveryStatus` first, and check if it contains a `courier` property.

To get the current location of your driver, use `getDriverLocation(options)` where `options` is an object containing the `deliveryID` of the delivery to track

> Example request

```shell
https://api.blip.delivery/getDriverLocation # Live API endpoint

https://test.blip.delivery/getDriverLocation # Test API endpoint

JSON body:

{
	deliveryID: "ASF781",
	storeID: "L12354Hhhf9-f"
}
```

		longitude: -79.6404522

}
```

### Response JSON

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
location.latitude | Number indicating the current latitude of the driver on your job
location.longitude | Number indicating the current longitude of the driver on your job

# Get deliveries

Sometimes, you may need all the delivery requests created by your store. You can use `getDeliveries` to get an array of all the `deliveryID`'s associated with your `storeID`

> Example request

```shell
https://api.blip.delivery/getDeliveries # Live API endpoint

# Get delivery

Sometimes, you might want to get a single delivery object that you can reference with it's corresponding `deliveryID`. To do this, use `getDelivery`, passing in a `deliveryID` in the request body. Alternatively, if you do not want to keep a track of the deliveryID, you can pass in an `orderNumber` & `appID` pair, and it'll retrieve the corresponding delivery, without needing to know the `deliveryID`

```shell
https://api.blip.delivery/getDelivery # Live API endpoint
